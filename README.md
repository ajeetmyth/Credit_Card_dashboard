# Credit_Card_dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing credit card transaction data alongside customer demographic information to uncover insights into spending behavior, revenue drivers, and customer segmentation. The dashboard integrates two datasets — Credit Card Transactions and Customer Profiles — to present a comprehensive, interactive view of financial performance and customer patterns.

Built using Power BI, the dashboard provides a wide range of visualizations covering transaction trends, spending categories, customer income levels, geographic distribution, and card performance. Interactive filters allow users to drill down into specific customer segments, payment methods, and time periods for informed decision-making.
